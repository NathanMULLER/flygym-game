## FlyGym: Gymnasium environments for NeuroMechFly

[**Documentation**](https://nely-epfl.github.io/flygym/)

**16 September 2023: Documentation will be updated in the coming days.**

This package implements [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org) environments for NeuroMechFly ([paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41592-022-01466-7), [code](https://github.com/NeLy-EPFL/NeuroMechFly)), a neuromechanical model of the fruit fly _Drosophila melanogaster_. Gymnasium is "a standard API for reinforcement learning, and a diverse collection of reference environments." The environments in this package serve as wrappers to provide a unified interface to interact with fly model in different physics simulators (PyBullet, MuJoCo, Isaac Gym).
